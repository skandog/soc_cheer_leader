# 2023 Update
The workflows which automated this applicatin have been disabled. While the application worked well, it was deemed to not be providing sufficient value to users to justify the energy use to keep it running. 

Thank you to all those that supported the development of this application.

## soc_cheer_leader

This is the repo for an automated twitter bot created with python. The code running the bot is hosted on Python Anywhere, 
however the up to date code will always be registered here.

### how to use

You will need to register for a Twitter Developer account, with elevated permissions granted. 
Once you have done this, access the API details and plug them into your dotenv file.
