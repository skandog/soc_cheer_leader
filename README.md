# soc_cheer_leader
This is the repo for an automated twitter bot created with python. The code running the bot is hosted on Python Anywhere, 
however the up to date code will always be registered here.

## how to use

You will need to register for a Twitter Developer account, with elevated permissions granted. 
Once you have done this, access the API details and plug them into your dotenv file.
